📡 Network Topology Collection






A curated collection of real Cisco Packet Tracer network topologies and configurations — designed to help learners, network engineers, and CCNA/CCNP aspirants understand how networks are built and configured.

🚀 Overview

This repository contains various network topology lab files built in Cisco Packet Tracer.
Each topology demonstrates a practical networking concept — from VLANs and inter-VLAN routing to dynamic routing protocols like OSPF.

Whether you’re:

preparing for certification exams,

building your home lab,

or exploring real world enterprise network designs —
this collection has examples you can open, study, and expand.

🗂️ Topology Catalog
#	Topology	Concept Covered	Screenshot
1	Two-Floor Switching	VLAN segmentation & basic switching	

2	Two Building Switch	L2 switching across buildings	

3	Inter-VLAN Routing	VLAN gateway using Layer3 device	(see .pkt files)
4	Multi-Area OSPF	OSPF routing between routers	(see .pkt files)
…	More to come	Dynamic routing, Enterprise LAN designs…	

📁 Each topology includes the Packet Tracer .pkt file and sometimes supporting images.

📌 Getting Started
🛠 Requirements

Cisco Packet Tracer (version 7.x or later recommended)

A computer or VM that can open .pkt files

🧠 How to Use

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/abhas101/Network-Topology.git


Open the .pkt file for the topology you want to explore.

Follow documented notes (if any) or inspect device configs inside Packet Tracer.
